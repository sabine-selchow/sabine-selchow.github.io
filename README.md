This is my personal GitHub page featuring interactive data visualizations created using HTML, CSS, D3.js, and CSV data.  
All datasets used in these visualizations were compiled by myself, mostly in the context of the ERC-funded project, Ecoint, at the European University Institute, Florence (grant No 885285).
